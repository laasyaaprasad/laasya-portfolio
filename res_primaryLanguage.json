By working with a dataset of 111 unique Ed Sheeran songs, the team analyzes a vocabulary of 4,632 unique words and over 62,000 tokens to develop and compare various models. The project leverages Python, TensorFlow, and PyTorch to implement techniques like Naive Bayes N-Gram models, RNNs with LSTM architecture, and GPT-2 Transformers. Key efforts include creating trigram probability graphs, calculating perplexity, and training models to predict and generate new lyrics. The results are evaluated using metrics like ROUGE scores and perplexity, shedding light on the strengths and limitations of each approach, from the simplicity of N-Grams to the advanced capabilities of GPT-2. This project not only pushes the boundaries of text generation but also highlights challenges like overfitting and model biases in creative AI applications‚Äã",
